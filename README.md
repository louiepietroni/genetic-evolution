# genetic-evolution
A genetic evolution exploration

This project started by creating a neural network library, which is then used to create agents which evolve through genetic evolution. I explored the effectiveness of these agents in several different games.

## Usage
Each of these games can be run showing agents during each generation from the files:
asteroids.py
drivingcar.py
flappybird.py

There are several keys which can be pressed to show different information while the simulation is running, eg. to show just the best agent, showing the neural network (brain) of the best agent, etc...
